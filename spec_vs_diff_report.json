  "summary": "The diff implements most of the requested requirements. All frontend sections (hero, trending facts, top 10 lists, guides, videos, quiz, calculators, downloads, category filter, share buttons, popular posts, new updates) appear to be present. The Motoko backend implements popular posts with view counts and new updates with timestamps. However, several specific acceptance criteria have gaps or cannot be confirmed from the truncated diff, and one requirement has a notable concern.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "At least 5 seed posts are pre-loaded in the backend",
      "reason": "The Motoko backend provides addPost() and viewPost() functions, but there is no seed data or init/post-upgrade function that pre-loads at least 5 posts. The posts list starts empty.",

      "reason": "The Quiz.tsx file is truncated and the results screen portion is cut off, so it cannot be confirmed that ShareButtons is rendered on the quiz results screen. The component is imported and used in FactCard and GuideCard, but quiz results inclusion is unverifiable.",
